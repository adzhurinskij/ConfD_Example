Example #5: Read-only Instrumentation in C
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates how you can instrument C applications to
become ConfD sources of read-only data, typically statistics or
operational information. To do this, the read-only part of the data
provider API is used.

此示例演示了如何使C应用程序成为只读数据的ConfD源，通常是统计信息或操作信息。 
为此，使用数据提供程序API的只读部分。

A NETCONF client called 'netconf-console' is used in this example.
The 'netconf-console' is part of the ConfD installation (found in
the 'bin' directory). This client communicates with ConfD over SSH and
requires Python Paramiko package (on Ubuntu you can install it by command
'apt-get install python-paramiko').

在此示例中使用名为“netconf-console”的NETCONF客户端。'netconf-console'是ConfD安装的一部分（位于'bin'目录中）。
这个客户端通过SSH与ConfD通信，需要Python Paramiko包
（在Ubuntu上你可以通过'apt-get install python-paramiko'命令安装它）

In case SSH cannot be used, there is 'netconf-console-tcp' variant. To
use 'netconf-console-tcp', update 'confd.conf' to enable
'netconf/transport/tcp' and change all 'netconf-console' calls
to 'netconf-console-tcp' (in 'Makefile').

What the Example does
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "arpstat" application is monitoring the operating system ARP
tables by running '/sbin/arp -an' whenever a manager asks for the
current status.  Arpstat is using the data provider API (read-only),
so to ConfD it's acting as an external read-only database, but it's
really drastically simpler than it sounds.

For Juniper CLI see line that begins with (J). Not available in ConfD Free.
For Cisco XR CLI see line that begins with (C). 

Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing 

        $ make all start

 2. To see what's happening inside ConfD, optionally tail the ConfD
    log file. Unless you have changed the default configuration for
    this example (see confd.conf) the command would be

        $ tail -f ./confd.log

 3. Start the CLI with 'make cli' and try some commands

       (J) > show status arpentries

       (C) > show arpentries

    Remember to use <TAB> to speed up command entry. Since the data is
    read-only, there really isn't much more you can do here. Type
    'exit' to terminate the CLI.

 4. You can also compose the same queries using NETCONF. Try the
    cmd-*.xml commands in the example:

       netconf-console cmd-get-all.xml
       netconf-console cmd-get-arpstat.xml
